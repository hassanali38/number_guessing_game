# number_guessing_game_ts_project02
I have made this number guessing game using TypeScript, Node.js, inquirer and chalk packages. I have added some extra functionalities in this game including displaying remaining chances and hint option etc.

## NPX Command
- The npx command is:
    ```bash
    npx number-guessing-byhassanali
    ```
